# Meet-Manager-Extension
#### This is a google meet extension that allows teachers to take attendance for their respective classes as many schools around the world, including mine, have become online due to the Covid - 19 pandemic. 

#### There are obviously going to be other extensions on the internet that will serve the same purpose but, we are trying to make our extension unique by adding in some additional features which other extensions will not have. These features would include auto-admit, auto-kick, and automatically creating a data report about the student's attendance for teachers. This data will then automatically be  stored locally on the computer in Microsoft Excel so that the report is secured and teachers can access it anytime for reference. 

#### Our extension is still a work in-progress, but what we have so far is uploaded onto this repository. 

#### Thank you!
